A lot of coding intro/tasks/projects from high school. We coded for about 1h-1h30min weekly using JS and HTML. <br />
Do not expect high quality code from these files, this was the begining of my coding adventure. A lot of these tasks/projects are also not finished. <br />
As you can see, there are a lot of folders added within multiple uploads. Could not upload everything at once, because of the excessive ammount of files. <br />
I can recommend checking out my snake project. you can find it in the "spill" folder.
