A lot of coding intro/tasks/projects from high school. We coded for about 1h-1h30min weekly using JS and HTML. 
Do not expect high quality code from these files, this was the begining of my coding adventure. 
As you can see, there are a lot of folders added within multiple uploads. Could not upload everything at once, because of the excessive ammount of files
